news='''On June 15, 2024, Côte d'Ivoire made history by becoming the first country to administer the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine to children, a groundbreaking development in the battle against a disease that claimed over 600,000 lives last year, mostly among children under five.

The R21-Matrix-M vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India, leverages Novavax’s Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance immune response. Prequalified by the WHO, it boasts an efficacy rate of 78%, exceeding the WHO’s 75% target, and aims to address the urgent need for malaria vaccines in endemic regions.

The rollout will begin in Abidjan and expand to 38 districts, with 15 African countries expected to introduce malaria vaccines by 2024, targeting 6.6 million children. The Serum Institute of India has manufactured 25 million doses, with plans to produce 100 million annually at under $4 per dose.'''

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In computer graphics, vectors are used to represent points, directions, and velocities. They are essential in defining the position and movement of objects in a graphical scene.

Matrices
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can represent linear transformations. In computer graphics, matrices are used to perform operations such as rotation, scaling, and translation. A single matrix can encapsulate multiple transformations, allowing for efficient computations.

Transformations
Transformations are operations that alter the position, size, and orientation of objects. Common transformations in computer graphics include:

Translation: Moving an object from one position to another.
Scaling: Changing the size of an object.
Rotation: Rotating an object around a point or axis.
Application in Computer Graphics
2D Transformations
In 2D graphics, transformations are applied to objects in a two-dimensional plane. For example, a 2D point 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) can be translated by a vector 
(
𝑡
𝑥
,
𝑡
𝑦
)
(tx,ty) using the following equation:
